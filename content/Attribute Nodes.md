What is an Attribute Node?

1. In Blender, a Geometry Node is like a mini-program that you can use to manipulate the geometry of your 3D model. It’s a way to tell Blender how to change the shapes, positions, and other properties of the vertices, edges, and faces that make up your model.

2. An Attribute Node is a specific type of node that you can add to your geometry node. It allows you to create and manage attributes, which are like variables or pieces of data that you can associate with your model. For example, you might have an attribute that stores the color of each vertex, or the position of each vertex in space.

3. When you add an Attribute Node, you’re telling Blender that you want to create a new piece of data that you can use in your geometry node. In this case, you’re creating a new attribute that will store the Poincaré coordinates of each vertex in your model.

4. The Poincaré coordinates are a way of representing points in hyperbolic space, which is a type of geometric space where the rules of geometry are a bit different from what you might be used to. By storing these coordinates in an attribute, you’re keeping track of where each vertex is in this hyperbolic space.

5. So, in simple terms, adding an Attribute Node to store Poincaré coordinates is like creating a new piece of data for each point in your 3D model that says where that point is located in a special type of geometric space called hyperbolic space. This can be useful for creating interesting and complex transformations and effects in your 3D models.
