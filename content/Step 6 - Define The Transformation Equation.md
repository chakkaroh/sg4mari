#### Choose a Projection Method:

- First, determine the specific projection method you want to use for your transformation. For this example, let's continue with the stereographic projection method.

#### Stereographic Projection Transformation Equation:

- The stereographic projection transformation equation is provided as: 
 $$   f(x, y) = \left( \frac{2x}{1 + x^2 + y^2}, \frac{2y}{1 + x^2 + y^2}, \frac{x^2 + y^2 - 1}{1 + x^2 + y^2} \right) $$
#### Understand the Equation:

-  This equation now needs to be applied to each vertex of your complex 3D mesh.
