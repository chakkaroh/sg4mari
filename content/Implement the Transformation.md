Implementing the transformation in Blender with Geometry Nodes involves creating a custom node network that applies the desired transformation to your geometry. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. **Open Blender**: Start by opening Blender and opening the project with your environment photoscans.

2. **Create a Geometry Node Network**: Go to the <font color="#00b050">Geometry Node Editor</font> by selecting it from the editor type selector at the top of the screen or by going to the "Layout" workspace where it might already be present.

3. **Add Geometry Nodes**: Click on "New" to create a new geometry node network.

4. **Import Your Environment Photoscans**: If you haven't already imported your environment photoscans into Blender, do so now. You can do this by using the "File" menu to import your images as planes or as meshes.

5. **Add a Point Instance Node**: In the Geometry Nodes editor, click "Add" and then search for and add a "Point Instance" node. Connect the output of this node to the "Geometry" input of the "Object Info" node.

6. **[[Step 6 - Define The Transformation Equation]]**: Now, you'll need to define the transformation. This will depend on the specific projection method you've chosen. If you're using a stereographic projection, for example, you can use the transformation equation provided earlier:

 $$   f(x, y) = \left( \frac{2x}{1 + x^2 + y^2}, \frac{2y}{1 + x^2 + y^2}, \frac{x^2 + y^2 - 1}{1 + x^2 + y^2} \right) $$

   You can implement this equation using Math Nodes in Blender.
  
7. **[[Step 7 - Add Math Nodes]]**: Add Math Nodes to perform the necessary calculations for the transformation equation. Use Multiply, Add, Divide, and Subtract nodes to implement the equation.

8. **Connect the Nodes**: Connect the output of the Point Instance node (which contains the original coordinates) to the input of the Math Nodes. Then, connect the output of the Math Nodes to the "Position" input of the Point Instance node.

9. **Adjust Parameters**: You may need to adjust parameters such as the position of the "North Pole" or the scale of the transformation to achieve the desired result. You can do this by adjusting the values in the Math Nodes.

10. **View the Result**: Switch to the 3D Viewport to see the result of the transformation applied to your environment photoscans.

11. **Fine-tune**: Depending on the specifics of your project, you may need to fine-tune the node network and parameters to achieve the desired result. Iterate on your node network and experiment with different settings until you're satisfied with the transformation.

12. **Render**: Once you're happy with the transformation, you can set up your scene for rendering and render your final image or animation.

By following these steps, you can implement the transformation in Blender using Geometry Nodes to create a non-Euclidean spherical geometry from your environment photoscans.
